   How  can youmake a good application? 
I am going to show you how you make a good application at a company and how you will convince them that you are going for it. Here are different lessons that you can follow, but there are also conditions that you must pay attention to in learning such lessons.


          Step 1. Always put at the beginning "Hello (name of the company) I hope you leave a positive reaction about my application.

step 2. if there is a question of why you want to be a staff there and not someone else, you always have to say why you want to be. If you have done that, you can type a small part of your experience so that they can find your story interesting.

step 3. if you have no experience with something you can always say that you do not know very well here but that you are always there for support.

step 4. Be convinced in for example a discord server or somewhere in a skype group where the owner or manager is.

step 5. also always say what you have experience and how you deal with it.

step 6. if you have been (or have been) a staff member you can always say what your tasks were there and what your experience was there as a staff.



These are all my steps. coming soon from the more lessons. Greetings Srenpai: D
